## Honkai: Star Rail Farming Tool

Pretty much what it says in the subtitle. This is going to be a tool for Honkai Star Rail, for character farming. I know some websites already do that, and I even use some of them (notably Seelie.me, which is really useful and a huge inspiration for me, definitely check it out!), but at the end of the day, they don't fully satisfy me. 

My main goal there is mostly to have a page for each character that has all of their info (rarity, path, element, playstyle, materials), with the possibility to compare the needed materials with the ones you have in-game. But, admittedly, I'd like to push it further. For example, I'd like to have a user authentification so users can make a list of existing characters they want to farm for and have a database keep their resources either with an account or locally, but also add their own characters. I would also love to add build recommendations and even a build calculator for relics. Perhaps even generate a possible farm planning with set priorities based on their list of characters to farm for.

I was already planning to do one of those for Genshin Impact, but I am not actually playing Genshin that much anymore. I may go back to it later anyway, as it still is good practice, but I'd rather work on something that actually interests me first. I also want to go further with this one than with the Genshin one, so I think it is a more interesting project!

Anyway, let's get to coding.

PS: ignore the next part, I'm going to do the same thing I did in my Genshin project and write down all of my own character information here to keep track of where I am in my own farm.
